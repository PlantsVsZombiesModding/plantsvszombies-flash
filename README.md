# Plants Vs Zombies Web Port Decompile.

### Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------

this was quite honestly hell to set up.

all I can remember I did was install FlashDevelop and the Flex SDK.

I couldn't get the custom decompiled resources.swf to work in the game.

so just use the normal resources.swf not the broken ones in the bin folder.

works for the most part.

### Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

if you want to help me then DM spaghetto207 on Discord.
also, please don't go pestering me about how to set this up, thanks.
