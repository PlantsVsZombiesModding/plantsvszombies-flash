# Plants Vs Zombies Web Port Decompile.

this was quite honestly hell to set up.
all i can remember i did was install FlashDevelop and the Flex SDK.
i couldnt get the custom decompiled resources.swf to work in the game.
so just use the normal resources.swf not the broken one in the bin folder.

works for the most part.

if you want to maybe help me then dm spaghetto207 on discord.
